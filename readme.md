# Project Kanban Guide

This project is meant to simulate a basic task management system. The project comprises a few basic apis and some unit tests.

The objective is to make the unit tests pass, they are ordered so the _1 is the first test to solve.

Main goal of this exercise is to see what your problem solving process is like. Feel free to google and ask any questions.

Donâ€™t worry about completing them all, get as far as you can. We will be assessing your approach. To the best of your ability, explain the decisions you make when changing the code to your assessor e.g.: 

 - Architectural choices 
 - Performance decisions 
 - Clean code 

## Rules
- You can't change the test code.

### Tips
- This is just a unit test project, the application can only be run/debugged using unit tests not from the standard F5/Run 
- The database tables are defined in ProjectKanban/Data/001.sql
- The intention of the tests is documented in the class and method name, read as Given When Then 
- You can navigate files names/types by pressing Ctrl + T
